An Path Finding App made with React and Tailwind CSS with some cool animations:

You can :
- Generate A maze using Binary Tree or Recursive Division
- Create a custom Maze
- Find the shortest Path using A star , Dijkstra
- Find a path using DFS or BFS
- toggle the preferred theme.

 For the Dijkstra and A Star algorithms , It is well known that the priority queue is the most relevant data structure allowing to retrieve the next pivot in a very low complexity . So the solution is to implement a class for this structure using a heap (array implementation) as TypeScript or JavaScript has a minimal Data Structures library .<br>
You Can check the implementation in this medium article in details: <br>
